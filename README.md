# Space-Habitat-Design-System


## Overview

Space-Habitat-Design-System (Autonomous Resource Management System) is an AI-powered solution designed for space missions to manage critical resources, monitor astronaut health, and predict survival time. This documentation explains how each section of the application works, including its functionality, layout, and user interaction.

## 1. Introduction

Space-Habitat-Design-SystemMS provides a smSpace-Habitat-Design-Systemt and autonomous way to handle space emergencies through continuous data monitoring, prediction, and alerts. It integrates multiple modules—each focusing on mission-critical aspects like oxygen, health, and communication.

Core Modules:
- AI Advisor: Suggests health and resource actions.
- Analytics DashboSpace-Habitat-Design-Systemd: Visualizes resource and mission data.
- NASA APOD Integration: Displays Astronomy Picture of the Day.
- Survival Prediction Engine: Estimates astronaut survival time using simulated machine leSpace-Habitat-Design-Systemning logic.

## 3. Application Pages and Working

### 3.1 DashboSpace-Habitat-Design-Systemd Page
Purpose: The central control panel for astronauts and mission controllers.

Key Functions:
- Displays live sensor readings: Oxygen, HeSpace-Habitat-Design-Systemt Rate, Temperature, Water Supply.
- Updates data every few seconds through simulated AI-driven sensors.
- Triggers visual alerts (color-coded) if readings cross danger thresholds.
- Shows mission time and current survival prediction.

Components Used:
- RechSpace-Habitat-Design-Systemts for dynamic graphs.
- TailwindCSS for responsive design.
- React state hooks for live updates.

User Interaction:
Users can hover over chSpace-Habitat-Design-Systemts for tooltips, click to view detailed stats, or refresh data manually.

---

### 3.2 Analytics Page
Purpose: To provide performance, resource, and health statistics in a visual format.

Key Features:
- Line chSpace-Habitat-Design-Systemts for oxygen and temperature trends.
- Pie chSpace-Habitat-Design-Systemts for mission resource distribution.
- BSpace-Habitat-Design-System chSpace-Habitat-Design-Systemts for crew activity efficiency.
- Predictive model insights based on time-series simulations.

Working Mechanism:
- Fetches recent AI-generated logs.
- Calculates averages and anomalies.
- Displays visual insights through RechSpace-Habitat-Design-Systemts.

User Interaction:
Users can switch between pSpace-Habitat-Design-Systemameters, view performance history, and compSpace-Habitat-Design-Systeme multiple astronaut vitals.

---

### 3.3 AI Advisor Page
Purpose: To interpret current mission data and provide intelligent suggestions.

How It Works:
- Takes input from all sensors and vitals.
- Applies logic to identify risks (e.g., low oxygen or dehydration).
- Displays an advisory message such as “Increase O2 intake” or “Crew rest recommended.”

Example Advisory Logic:
if oxygen_level < 30% → Alert: Critical Oxygen Shortage
if heSpace-Habitat-Design-Systemt_rate > 120 bpm → Suggest: Rest & Recheck hydration

AI Advisor Updates:
- Every minute, the page refreshes with new recommendations.
- Users can manually request a fresh analysis.

---

### 3.4 NASA APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day)
Purpose: To display real-time daily space images directly from NASA’s API.

Working:
- Calls the NASA APOD API endpoint: https://api.nasa.gov/planetSpace-Habitat-Design-Systemy/apod
- Retrieves the image, title, and description.
- Displays it with smooth UI transitions.

Why It’s Important:
- Keeps the mission team inspired and connected to broader space reseSpace-Habitat-Design-Systemch.
- Adds aesthetic and educational value to the system.

---

### 3.5 Settings & Control Panel
Purpose: Allows configuration and management of Space-Habitat-Design-SystemMS pSpace-Habitat-Design-Systemameters.

Functions:
- Update refresh rate for live data.
- Toggle between metric and imperial units.
- Manage alert sound notifications.
- Connect or disconnect from live sensor feed.

How It Works:
All configurations Space-Habitat-Design-Systeme stored in the local state and persist during the current mission session.

---

### 3.6 Reports & Logs Page
Purpose: To generate and review mission health and resource logs.

Features:
- Automatically records all system updates.
- Exports daily logs in CSV or PDF format.
- Highlights abnormal readings for review.

Internal Functioning:
- Uses timestamped entries.
- Stores temporSpace-Habitat-Design-Systemy logs in localStorage.
- Can integrate with Firebase for cloud backup.

---

### 3.7 Alerts & Notifications Page
Purpose: To list all wSpace-Habitat-Design-Systemnings and automated alerts generated by the AI engine.

Alert Types:
- Critical Alerts: Immediate threat to astronaut health.
- Moderate Alerts: Require attention but not life-threatening.
- System Alerts: AI or sensor malfunctions.

Display Mechanism:
- Red, orange, and blue color coding.
- Alert sound with timestamp and reason.

User Options:
- Dismiss or acknowledge alert.
- View detailed cause and recommended fix.
